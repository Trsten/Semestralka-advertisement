<h2 class="text-center">How To Decide If A Home Is Right For You</h2>
<p class="text-left w-50 p-3 col-6 card bg-light mb-3 rounded mx-auto d-block">Picking out a new house can be exciting and terrifying at the same time. How do you choose the best location? What if the house has problems you can't afford to fix? What’s the tiebreaker if you love two places equally?

    The first and only way to begin the decision-making process is to grab your calculator. A dream home becomes a nightmare the moment you can't afford it. “As you calculate, look beyond the listing price,” says Steve Jones, associate broker of Crawford Olson Real Estate in McCall, Idaho. Here’s why: A house with a vaulted ceiling costs more to heat than one with a low ceiling. And a house with a pool means paying to maintain it. All these extra factors can add up.

    Trainor says he's noticed that when a house is a good fit for a buyer, the couple or family will begin to talk about where they'd place their furniture. “When a client is doing this, he or she is mentally moving into the home,” says Trainor. The upshot? If you're viewing a house and find yourself imagining your sofa near the window and your green chair near the fireplace, pay attention. Chances are, the house is a nice match for you.

    That said, there's no such thing as a crystal ball when it comes to house hunting. And wondering whether the house will be too small if you get a dog—or too big when the kids leave for college—is inevitable. But Cindy Jones, also of Crawford Olson Real Estate, says that while it's important to envision a home's role over time, making a decision with too many variables in mind can work against you. “Buy the house for the way you are living today,” she says. Then adapt as you go.
